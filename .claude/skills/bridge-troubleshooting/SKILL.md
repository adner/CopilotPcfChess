# Bridge troubleshooting playbook

The loop has three hops: **PCF → Copilot** (`Xrm.Copilot.sendPromptToM365Copilot`), **agent → MCP tool**,
**tool/viewer → PCF** (the nudge). Most failures are one specific misconfiguration. Find the symptom.

## Symptom → cause → fix

**Component iframe is blank / nothing loads (often NO console error).**
→ **Mixed content.** The server URL is `http://…` (or `http://localhost`) but the Power App is served over
**HTTPS**, so the browser silently blocks the sub-resource. Fix: run the server behind the **HTTPS
devtunnel** and set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (mcp-server `.env`), the PCF `serverBaseUrl` property, **and** the
manifest `external-service-usage` domain **all** to that same `https://…devtunnels.ms` base. See
`bidirectional-pcf-agent` for the coupling.

**You keep seeing the OLD PCF build after pushing.**
→ **ControlManifest version not bumped.** UCI caches the bundle by control **version**. Fix: bump `version`
in `ControlManifest.Input.xml` (patch is fine) **before every** `npm run build && pac pcf push`, then
hard-reload the app (Ctrl+Shift+R); if still stale, Publish all customizations and wait ~1 min. See
`pcf-develop-deploy`.

**The table shows the DEFAULT read-only grid, not your PCF (no console error).**
→ The `CustomControlDefaultConfig` grid binding didn't apply. Two causes seen: **(a) wrong placement** —
the `<CustomControlDefaultConfigs>` block was written inside the inner `<entity Name="…">` instead of on
the **outer `<Entity>`** (sibling of `<FormXml>`/`<SavedQueries>`/`<RibbonDiffXml>`); import silently drops
it. **(b) the carrier solution was deleted** — the binding rides in the unmanaged solution you imported it
through, and deleting that solution removes the binding. Fix: re-run `bind-grid.mjs` (correct placement,
handles the split `Entities/<table>/Entity.xml` layout), **keep** the carrier solution, and verify by
re-exporting the solution and confirming the block sits under the outer `<Entity>`. See `pcf-develop-deploy`.

**`pac pcf push` fails with `System.Xml.XmlException` or a `noAposStringType` XSD error.**
→ The manifest has an XML- or XSD-invalid attribute value that the webpack build didn't catch: a raw
`<`/`>`/`&`, or an apostrophe in a `display-name-key`/`description-key`. Escape the entities and remove
apostrophes. See `pcf-develop-deploy` RULE 1b.

**Component's own `fetch` of its `/data` (or `/state`) fails with a null-origin / CORS error.**
→ **iframe `sandbox` missing `allow-same-origin`.** A sandboxed iframe without it gets an opaque origin, so
every self-fetch becomes a null-origin CORS failure. Fix: `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` on
the tile iframe.

**`fetch` blocked by the document's own Content-Security-Policy.**
→ The assembled document's `<meta>` CSP lacks `connect-src`. Fix: ensure `connect-src 'self'` (and
`img-src data:` if you embed images) in the doc's META CSP. Framing blocked instead? That's the *tile*
response header `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors …` — it must allow `https://*.dynamics.com`.

**The nudge never arrives at the PCF (agent ran, pane showed the card, but the PCF didn't react).**
→ Two common causes: **(a) frame depth** — the Copilot pane is a nested iframe; the viewer must post the
message to `window.top`, `window.parent`, AND `window.parent.parent`. **(b) single registration** — the
PCF must listen via **BOTH** `Xrm.Copilot.addActionHandler(action, h)` **and** a raw
`window.addEventListener("message", …)` filtering on `eventName` + `action`. Wire only one and it's flaky.
Also confirm the `eventName`/`action` strings match exactly on both ends. See `bidirectional-pcf-agent`.

**The pane card never renders (the tool ran — you see it in the logs — but no UI in Copilot).**
→ **Missing `_meta.ui.resourceUri`** on the tool's entry in the agent's `mcp-tools.json` (it must match the
viewer URI the server registers). This is the easiest sync step to forget. See `declarative-agent-sync`.

**The agent never calls your new tool.**
→ The tool isn't in **`run_for_functions[]`** in `ai-plugin.json`, and/or isn't described in
`instruction.txt`. Re-do the three-file sync (`mcp-tools.json` `tools[]`, `ai-plugin.json` `functions[]` +
`run_for_functions[]`, `instruction.txt`). See `declarative-agent-sync`.

**`sendPromptToM365Copilot` opens the WRONG agent (or a generic Copilot).**
→ **Wrong gptId.** You passed `TEAMS_APP_ID`; it must be **`M365_TITLE_ID`** (`T_<guid>` /
`U_<guid>.declarativeAgentPowerApps`). Verify the live value: open the agent, run
`Xrm.Copilot.getCurrentAgent()` in DevTools.

**A generated widget renders blank even though data is present.**
→ The render code created elements but never `appendChild`'d them, or reached for an external
resource/`eval` that the host CSP blocked (silent). Keep widget code **vanilla-only** and confirm every
created node is attached. See `mcp-apps-tool-dev`.

**`npm run serve` shows a "viewer not built" fallback page.**
→ You didn't `npm run build` first. The viewer is a Vite single-file bundle; build before serve.

## Where to look (observation points)

- **`mcp-server/logs/*.jsonl`** — one file per tool call; the user-facing error carries a `(log: <8char>)`
  handle that matches the filename. Start here for tool failures.
- **VS Code "MCP" output channel** — server stderr mirror / connection status (`.vscode/mcp.json` points
  the client at `http://localhost:3101/mcp`).
- **DevTools inside the Copilot pane** — for `postMessage`/CSP/nudge issues; run `Xrm.Copilot.getCurrentAgent()`
  here to confirm the live gptId, and watch the Console for CSP violations and the Network tab for blocked
  fetches.
- **`npm run probe`** — reproduce a tool host-free before blaming the host. If `probe` is green but Copilot
  fails, the problem is in the agent sync or the bridge, not the tool.

## Rule of thumb

Isolate the hop. If `probe` works, the tool is fine → suspect the **agent sync** (tool not routed) or the
**bridge** (nudge/CSP/sandbox). If the component won't even load, suspect **mixed content** or a **stale
bundle** first — those two account for most "it just doesn't work" reports.
